# State Rendering

> Render your agent's state with custom UI components in real-time.


<!-- interactive demo: shared-state-streaming -->


## What is this?

State rendering lets you build UI that reflects your agent's state in real-time. As your agent progresses through nodes and emits state updates, your frontend renders those changes, showing progress, drafts, or intermediate results.

  **Free course:** See this pattern built end-to-end in [Build Interactive Agents with Generative UI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/build-interactive-agents-with-generative-ui/) — a free DeepLearning.AI short course taught by CopilotKit's CEO covering the full Generative UI spectrum (Controlled, Declarative, and Open-Ended).
</Callout>

## When should I use this?

Use state rendering when you want to:

- Show real-time progress (e.g. "Researching... 2/5 complete")
- Display drafts that update as the agent works
- Build dashboards that reflect agent state
- Render structured output outside of the chat

## How it works in code

On the frontend, subscribe to the agent's state. Each time the backend
forwards a fresh value, your component re-renders with the latest partial
output.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/shared-state-streaming/page.tsx
  // Subscribe to BOTH state changes and run-status changes. The former
  // drives the per-token document rerender; the latter toggles the
  // "LIVE" badge when the agent starts / stops.
  const { agent } = useAgent({
    agentId: "shared-state-streaming",
    updates: [UseAgentUpdate.OnStateChanged, UseAgentUpdate.OnRunStatusChanged],
  });
```

On the backend, a state-streaming mapping forwards a specific tool argument
straight into a state key *as it's being generated*. Some frameworks provide
that as middleware; direct SDK adapters can emit `STATE_SNAPSHOT` events from
their streaming loop. Either way, the UI can watch the answer assemble
token-by-token rather than appearing in one burst between checkpoints.

```python
# src/agents/shared_state_streaming.py
import uuid

from langchain.agents import AgentState as BaseAgentState, create_agent
from langchain.tools import ToolRuntime, tool
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.types import Command

from copilotkit import (
    CopilotKitMiddleware,
    StateItem,
    StateStreamingMiddleware,
)


class AgentState(BaseAgentState):
    """Shared state. `document` is streamed token-by-token."""

    document: str


@tool
def write_document(document: str, runtime: ToolRuntime) -> Command:
    """Write a document for the user.

    Always call this tool when the user asks you to write or draft
    something of any length (an essay, poem, email, summary, etc.).
    The `document` argument is streamed *per token* into shared agent
    state under the `document` key, so the UI can render it as it is
    generated.
    """
    return Command(
        update={
            "document": document,
            "messages": [
                ToolMessage(
                    content="Document written to shared state.",
                    name="write_document",
                    id=str(uuid.uuid4()),

                )

        # the tool call completes.
        #
        # NOTE: the frontend `usePredictStateSubscription` hook indexes
        # the (partial-JSON-parsed) tool args by `state_key`, so the
        # tool's argument name MUST match `state_key` ("document") for
        # per-token deltas to land in `state.document`.
