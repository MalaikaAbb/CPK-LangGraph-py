# State Streaming

> Stream partial agent state updates to the UI while a tool call is still running.


<!-- interactive demo: shared-state-streaming -->


## What is this?

By default, agent state only updates *between* backend checkpoints, so
a long-running tool call (writing a full document, drafting an email)
appears to the UI as one big burst at the end. For agent-native apps,
that feels broken: users expect to watch the output materialise.

**State streaming** forwards the value of a specific tool argument
straight into an agent state key *as the argument is being generated*.
The UI, subscribed via `useAgent`, re-renders every token.

## When should I use this?

Use state streaming whenever a tool's output is long-form text or a
growing structured value and you want the user to see it assemble in
real time. Common shapes:

- A collaborative writing agent that emits a document
- A research agent that accumulates a list of findings
- A planning agent that builds up a step-by-step plan

Without streaming, the user stares at a spinner. With streaming, they
see the answer grow token-by-token.

## The backend: one streaming state mapping

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install the LangGraph Python SDK

    <InstallPythonSDK />

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Add state streaming middleware

    `StateStreamingMiddleware` maps a tool argument to an agent state key and
    forwards partial tool-call arguments as state updates while the model is
    still generating.

The backend pattern is always the same: map one streaming tool argument
to one shared-state key. Middleware-backed frameworks usually expose
this as a declarative mapping — for example, LangGraph Python's
`StateStreamingMiddleware` with `StateItem(...)` entries, or
`copilotkitCustomizeConfig` with an `emitIntermediateState` mapping for
LangGraph TypeScript graphs. Direct SDK adapters do the same work in
their streaming loop by parsing partial tool arguments and emitting
`STATE_SNAPSHOT` whenever the mapped value changes. When the LLM streams
that argument, CopilotKit writes every partial value into shared state
before the tool even finishes executing.

```python
# src/agents/shared_state_streaming.py
import uuid

from langchain.agents import AgentState as BaseAgentState, create_agent
from langchain.tools import ToolRuntime, tool
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.types import Command

from copilotkit import (
    CopilotKitMiddleware,
    StateItem,
    StateStreamingMiddleware,
)


class AgentState(BaseAgentState):
    """Shared state. `document` is streamed token-by-token."""

    document: str


@tool
def write_document(document: str, runtime: ToolRuntime) -> Command:
    """Write a document for the user.

    Always call this tool when the user asks you to write or draft
    something of any length (an essay, poem, email, summary, etc.).
    The `document` argument is streamed *per token* into shared agent
    state under the `document` key, so the UI can render it as it is
    generated.
    """
    return Command(
        update={
            "document": document,
            "messages": [
                ToolMessage(
                    content="Document written to shared state.",
                    name="write_document",
                    id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
                    tool_call_id=runtime.tool_call_id,
                )
            ],
        }
    )


graph = create_agent(
    model=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-5.4"),
    tools=[write_document],
    middleware=[
        CopilotKitMiddleware(),
        # Forward every token of write_document's `document` argument
        # straight into state["document"] while the tool call is still
        # streaming. Without this, `document` would only update once
        # the tool call completes.
        #

        # tool's argument name MUST match `state_key` ("document") for
        # per-token deltas to land in `state.document`.
        StateStreamingMiddleware(
            StateItem(
                state_key="document",
                tool="write_document",
                tool_argument="document",
            )
        ),
    ],
    state_schema=AgentState,
    system_prompt=(
        "You are a collaborative writing assistant. Whenever the user asks "
        "you to write, draft, or revise any piece of text, ALWAYS call the "
        "`write_document` tool with the full content as a single string in "
        "the `document` argument. Never paste the document into a chat "
        "message directly — the document belongs in shared state and the "
        "UI renders it live as you type."
    ),
)
```

A few things to note:

- The state key must exist in your agent state (`document` in this demo).
- The tool and argument names must match the exact LLM-facing tool call
  you want to forward (`write_document.document` here).
- When the tool call completes, its final return value is written to
  the same key, so the streamed partial eventually becomes the
  authoritative final value.

## The frontend: useAgent + OnStateChanged

The UI side is identical to any other shared-state subscription:
`useAgent` with `OnStateChanged` gives you a reactive `agent.state`.
Add `OnRunStatusChanged` if you want a "LIVE" / "done" indicator.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/shared-state-streaming/page.tsx
  // Subscribe to BOTH state changes and run-status changes. The former
  // drives the per-token document rerender; the latter toggles the
  // "LIVE" badge when the agent starts / stops.
  const { agent } = useAgent({
    agentId: "shared-state-streaming",
    updates: [UseAgentUpdate.OnStateChanged, UseAgentUpdate.OnRunStatusChanged],
  });
```

From there, `agent.state.document` is just a string that grows on every
token, and `agent.isRunning` tells you whether to show a streaming
indicator.
