"""Backing graph for State Streaming, State Rendering and the Shared State overview.

https://docs.copilotkit.ai/langgraph-python/shared-state  (the "Streaming partial
state updates" section prints this same file)

Reproduced as printed — this is one of the few pages that publishes a complete,
runnable module. Only two things differ from the page: the model constant (see
`_shared.py` on `gpt-5.4`) and the checkpointer, which the active transport
supplies.

Three routes point here. State Streaming is the page that teaches the mechanism;
State Rendering re-uses the identical agent to make the "render it outside the
chat" point; the Shared State overview quotes it as its streaming example.
